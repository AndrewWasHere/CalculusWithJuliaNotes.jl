# Derivatives

A key concept in calculus is the tangent line to a graph. Intuitively, the tangent line at a point on a graph of a function is the line that "best" approximates the function nearby that point. Using the concept of a limit allows tangent lines and their slopes to be rigorously defined. That the tangent line approximates the function near a point will be exploited in different ways.
